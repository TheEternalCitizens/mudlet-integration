Likely the basic answers you want on key bindings are at:
  https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Introduction#Keybindings
  
In short Key Bindings replace a key press with the code you specif.
You will notice in the TEC_Client_KeyBindings folder there are key bindings
to replace num pad keys with directions. ctrl+r runs a room check.

Any code written in the Your_Key_Bindings folder will never be changed by Pathia updates.
We highly recommend backing up all the Your_ files in your `The Eternal City` mudlet profile.
We have made an aliase to easy open the folder these files are in.
To run it type `tecclient Your_Files`
Also you will see that aliase in Your_Aliases folder.

Parthia is intended to be a community project.
As we wrote code we made certain to comment nearly every line.
There will be many examples to reference in TEC_Client_Aliases.

We are happy to answer questions.
