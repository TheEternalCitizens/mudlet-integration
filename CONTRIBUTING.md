Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## How use git and github

We use [git](https://hackernoon.com/understanding-git-fcffd87c15a3) to track our file changes when developing. If you are new to git, consider familiarizing yourself with some git basics by reading [this](https://hackernoon.com/understanding-git-fcffd87c15a3) and [this](https://hackernoon.com/understanding-git-2-81feb12b8b26).

1. Make [an account with github](https://github.com/join) and [login](https://github.com/login)
1. Once you're logged in, fork the repository by pressing this button:

1. Download and install [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
1. [Clone your fork](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/cloning-a-repository-from-github-desktop)
1. Do not work on `master`, instead [make a new branch](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-branch-for-your-work)
1. Make your changes. Keep them small and focused. Make them only do **one thing**. If you have many things you want to do, do each of them on a separate branch. If you need some stuff from one branch on another, **wait** and do these changes after we merge your initial changes to `master`.
1. [Commit your changes](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project). Commit early, commit often. Make lots of little commits with clear messages explaining why you did something.
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-pull-request) from your fork to the main repository. In the pull request description, write an explanation of what you're trying to accomplish.


## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
