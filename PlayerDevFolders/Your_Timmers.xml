Likely the basic answers you want on timers are at:
  https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Timer_Engine
  
In short timers wait for the timeframe to cycle than process affiliated code.
Parthia does not have any timmers for reference.
That does not mean they will not be important for you.
Use them if they save you time or make a complex problem simple.

Any code written in the Your_Timmers folder will never be deleted by Pathia updates.
We highly recommend backing up all the Your_ folders in the editor.
You could do this by:
  selecting the folder, and click export at the top of the page
  right clicking the folder, select copy than paste that data into a text editor

Parthia is intended to be a community project.
As we wrote code we made certain to comment nearly every line.
There will be many examples to reference in TEC_Client_Aliases.

We are happy to answer questions.
