Likely the basic answers you want on key bindings are at:
  https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Introduction#Keybindings
  
In short Key Bindings replace a key press with the code you specif.
You will notice in the TEC_Client_KeyBindings folder there are key bindings
to replace num pad keys with directions. ctrl+r runs a room check.

Any code written in the Your_Key_Bindings folder will never be deleted by Pathia updates.
We highly recommend backing up all the Your_ folders in the editor.
You could do this by:
  selecting the folder, and click export at the top of the page
  right clicking the folder, select copy than paste that data into a text editor

Parthia is intended to be a community project.
As we wrote code we made certain to comment nearly every line.
There will be many examples to reference in TEC_Client_Aliases.

We are happy to answer questions.
