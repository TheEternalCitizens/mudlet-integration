Likely the basic answers you want on triggers are at:
  https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Introduction#Aliases
  
In short an alias: replaces a command the user enters with the script of your making.

Any code written in the Your_Aliases folder will never be deleted by Pathia updates.
We highly recommend backing up all the Your_ folders in the editor.
You could do this by:
  selecting the folder, and click export at the top of the page
  right clicking the folder, select copy than paste that data into a text editor

Parthia is intended to be a community project.
As we wrote code we made certain to comment nearly every line.
There will be many examples to reference in TEC_Client_Aliases.

We are happy to answer questions.
