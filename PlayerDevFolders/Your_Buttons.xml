Likely the basic answers you want on key bindings are at:
  https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Introduction#Buttons
  
In short Buttons make it considerably easier to make a graphical element within mudlet.
Parthia developers do not use buttons at this time.
Though if you are wanting to make a button or other graphical element this is
likely where you will want to create it.

We highly recommend you keep your buttons code within the Your_buttons folder.
Any code written in the Your_Buttons folder will never be changed by Pathia updates.
We highly recommend backing up all the Your_ files in your `The Eternal City` mudlet profile.
We have made an aliase to easy open the folder these files are in.
To run it type `tecclient Your_Files`
Also you will see that aliase in Your_Aliases folder.

Parthia is intended to be a community project.
As we wrote code we made certain to comment nearly every line.
There will be many examples to reference in TEC_Client_Aliases.

We are happy to answer questions.
