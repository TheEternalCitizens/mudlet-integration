From fastest trigger type to slowest
exact match > begin of line > substring > regex

In otherwords don't use a a substring where a begin of line or exact match would work. ONLY use regex when you have to.
____________________
When looking for patterns in string use lua patterns before regex.
So string.match and rex.match only when needed.
