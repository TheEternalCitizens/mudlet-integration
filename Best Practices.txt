____________________
From fastest trigger type to slowest
exact match > begin of line > substring > regex
In otherwords don't use a a substring where a begin of line or exact match would work. ONLY use regex when you have to.
____________________
When looking for patterns in strings use lua patterns before regex.
So string.match and rex.match only when needed.
____________________
when making gui elements
Use themes so we can easily change color schemes.
They are in scripts - Variables Data Temeses
Example:
AlreadyCreatedTabGeyserObject:setStyleSheet(tabsStyle) --Tabes style sheet
AlreadyCreatedTabGeyserObject:echo(tabsFontStyle.."Text on tab") --Put the name of the tab
AlreadyCreatedLabel:setStyleSheet(labelsStyle) --set to default label style
AlreadyCreatedButton:setStyleSheet(buttonsStyle) --button style sheet
AlreadyCreatedButton:echo(buttonsFontStyle.."Text on button")
Name, x, y, width, height, still need to be greated when the geyser object is. Those are different from windows to window.

--Things to do:

Teach Dave test best location to store references like this.
____________________
Make certain I have local data types where globals are not required.
Best method.
Look in variables script.
Look in the variables section to the left of the screen. variables that are no windows. May not need to be global functions.

Get a fully working login. Including md5 hash.

Macro Bar under scripts > GUI

Create resize event for communications menu. I would like to tackle that. Because it got real personal and frustrating. Just setting a reminder :).
_____________________
Get good looking colors.
I am no good at color schemes
_____________________
Find good gradiant tool and make the status bars just look better. Encumberance isn't even the right color, it should be blue. 
Keep the current colors for each for now. It is what the player base is use to.
heal red, fatigue yellow, hunger green, encumberance blue

Fix all the client help commands to have cechoLink
When someone types display. It shows a list of things the display command can do. Each command listed there should be clickable.
For reference I have done. [display clear] It is under aliases - display
For this to work ALL of the commands need to have a corrisponding function if they do not already. Most do already though.
_____________________
likely using ftext make all <center> declarations centered text.
ftext is already in mudlet community functions - TextFormater.
Some how have not got around to it.
It actually would work if we were not using hreplace hinsert for the color codes.
I've tested mudlets standard centering it does odd things with the welcome window.
_____________________
Created the I'll call it nest of functions needed for the help command. Specifically help client.
I started help client for reference. In short. A function is required with an echolink.
Even if all we want is to display simple text help message. As a result when we type help. Than click help client. It calls a function. help client should show all of our client command They are all catogorised. So there are not too many at this time.


--POST release 1:

Mudlet map. The generic mapper doesn't look bad to impliment. Though I have the feeling that it eats a lot of processing cycles.

Create command to change font type. font size has already been created.
This one could be [font type] it would display a clickable list of font types. They could run the command for the user. So send("font sans serif"). The user could just type the font type if they wanted, but honestly who remembers how to spell font names.

Make a trigger based sound system.
When someone is walking. Walking sounds play.
When a hit lands in a fight it plays a sound. Would be best if they were weapon specific. Sword sounds over and over get frustrating. I like the idea of these sounds maxing at 50% of the system's sound they are playing on. By default most people put the sound too loud and get tired after a time.

Would like to offer an olive branch to GMs.
Oddly I have had nearly no responce to any questions. You would think playing for 20 years. Having a $30 a month premium account, and building a high end client for their game would warrant a "Hey let me see if can help with that." Though I think their current business setup prevents them. I am guessing when TEC splits from skotos things will be better.
At any RATE!
I would like to offer the GMs. They send text. We do something.
They send text, we display an image. They send text, we play a song.

I want lightning.
I want a toggleable weather affect.
When it is storming. At a random set interval say 3 - 5 minutes. A thunder will play and the screen will flash for a moment. 
_________________
Convert all regex triggers to lua functions.
To save on processing time, convert all regex triggers to lua functions triggers. It is very common for lua functions to be 450% faster than regex triggers.

--Should we? tasks:

I dislike the work fatigue in a game as main reference for endurance. I wanted to poll the question if we should change it. So when ever someone typed a command that said fatigue. It said endurance.
Probably create a poll on the forum. Than still offer a command to enable disable.
